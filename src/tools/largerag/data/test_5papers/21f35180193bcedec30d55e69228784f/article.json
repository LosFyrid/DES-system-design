To further improve the reactivity towards formaldehyde and increase the substitution degree of phenol, masson pine alkali lignin (MAL) was pretreated by an acidic deep eutectic solvent (DES). It was found that adding an appropriate amount of water to DES showed beneficial attributions to the reduction in pre­ treatment time and the upsurge in the phenolic hydroxyl content of regenerated lignin (DAL). The content of $\\beta$ -O4 ether bond in MAL was almost cleaved. More importantly, the contents of syringyl and guaiacyl units were decreased. In contrast, the content of $p$ -hydroxyphenyl (H) units was increased obviously, thereby facilitating lignin to react with formaldehyde. Results showed that the optimized DAL with higher content of H units was an appropriate candidate for substituting $1 0 0 \\%$ of phenol in the preparation of highly-ordered lignin-derived mesoporous carbon (LDMC). Finally, the optimized LDMC exhibited high specific capacitance of $1 9 7 . 3 2 \\mathrm { F } \\mathrm { g } ^ { - 1 }$ at current density of $0 . 2 \\mathrm { ~ A ~ g ^ { - 1 } }$ , high capacitance retention of $8 4 \\%$ at current density of $2 0 \\textrm { A g } ^ { - 1 }$ , superior cyclic stability with capacitance retention rate of $9 9 . 0 9 \\%$ after 10000 cycles and high energy density of $6 . 8 5 \\mathrm { W h } { \\cdot } \\mathrm { k g } ^ { - 1 }$ at power density of $1 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { W ~ k g ^ { - 1 } }$ .

OMC is considered as an ideal electrode material for high per­ formance energy storage devices, especially supercapacitors [3,4]. Generally, OMC contains multi-scale pores (micropore $\\cdot { < } 2 \\ \\mathrm { n m } \\rangle$ , meso­ pore $\\left( 2 { - } 5 0 \\ \\mathrm { n m } \\right)$ and macropore $\\mathrm { ( > 5 0 ~ n m ) }$ ), which provides sufficient space for the mass transfer of ions and maximizes the specific capaci­ tance of supercapacitor [5]. It was reported that micropores provided active sites for storing energy in the adsorption-desorption process of electrolyte ions, but most micropores could not contact electrolyte so­ lution directly due to their closed-pores and narrow bottle-necks [6]. Fortunately, uniform and interpenetrating mesoporous channels could not only promote surface access, but also help electrolyte ions reach micropores by providing a wider transport path [7]. Besides, macro­ pores could be used as ion buffer reservoirs [8]. Therefore, multi-layer interconnected ordered porous carbon with macropores, mesopores and micropores (such as OMC) employed as electrode material is one of the effective ways to prepare supercapacitors with excellent electro­ chemical properties.

However, due to the depletion of oil resources, it is imperative to find renewable alternatives. Lignin, the second most abundant natural biopolymer after cellulose [10], offers enormous beneficial character­ istics, such as aromatic structure similar to phenol, wide sources, low cost and renewability, making it a high-quality carbon source for the sustainable synthesis of OMC [11]. Furthermore, it is evident that the availability of aromatic ortho-positions (C-3 and C-5) in lignin structure plays a vital role in making lignin a green and sustainable substitute for phenol in the preparation of phenolic resin-based functional materials. However, many of the ortho-positions of phenol hydroxyl (ArOH) groups are occupied by methoxyl groups, which may limit the substitution degree of phenol while fabricating the ordered lignin-derived meso­ porous carbon (LDMC) [12]. Several efforts had been dedicated to facilitating lignin valorization in the synthesis of LDMC. Methanol-soluble fraction of hardwood alkali lignin was used to react with formaldehyde for preparing LDMC with specific surface area and mesopore volume of $4 1 \\bar { 8 } \\ \\mathrm { { m } ^ { 2 } \\mathrm { { g } ^ { - 1 } } }$ and $0 . 3 4 ~ \\mathrm { c m } ^ { 3 } \\ : \\bar { \\mathrm { g } ^ { - 1 } }$ [9], but leading to an under-utilization of alkali lignin. Softwood lignin containing a higher content of guaiacyl (G) unit than that of syringyl (S) unit was employed to synthesize LDMC with specific surface area and pore volume of $4 6 6 ~ \\mathrm { m } ^ { 2 } ~ \\mathrm { g } ^ { - 1 }$ and $0 . 6 2 \\ \\mathrm { c m } ^ { 3 } \\ \\mathrm { g } ^ { - 1 }$ , reflecting that lignin with low molecular weight and high ArOH content was conducive to the formation of OMC [13]. Using phenolization method, the molecular weight of masson pine alkali lignin (MAL) was decreased and its $\\mathrm { \\bf A r O H }$ content was increased simultaneously [14], thereby improving its reactivity towards formal­ dehyde and obtaining a highly-ordered LDMC with specific surface area and mesopore volume of $\\bar { 2 6 2 } \\mathrm { m } ^ { 2 } \\mathrm { g } ^ { - 1 }$ and $0 . 0 6 7 ~ \\mathrm { c m } ^ { 3 } \\bar { \\mathrm { \\Phi g } } ^ { - 1 }$ [15]. However, the substitution degree of phenol was only $2 5 \\ \\mathrm { w t \\% }$ . To facilitate the utilization of lignin as a high-quality supplier of aromatic compounds and reduce the dependence on oil, it is promising and urgent to modify the structure of industrial lignin via green technology.

Due to the mild acid-base catalysis mechanism provided from DES, unstable ether bonds and some C–C bonds between phenylpropane units in lignin structure could be broken [20], thus resulting in the depolymerization of lignin macromolecule and the regeneration of lignin fractions with higher ArOH content, lower molecular weight and nano size [21]. Moreover, it was found that the addition of a third component (such as alcohols [22], lewis acids [23], water (W) [24], etc.) to binary DES could modulate the physicochemical properties of DES to a certain extent and enhance its pretreatment effectiveness upon lignocellulose. Among them, water has low viscosity, low cost, wide sources, and it is one of the few natural substances that can act as a hydrogen bond donor or a hydrogen bond acceptor [25–27]. Therefore, the addition of a certain amount of water as a third component could decrease the viscosity of DES dramatically, thus stimulating the mass transfer and adjusting the interactions among DES components, and leading to an improvement of pretreatment effi­ ciency of DES on lignocellulose [26,28].

            "paragraph": "To better understand the potential contribution of water to the lignin pretreatment using ternary DES, the effect of mass ratio of W to ChCl and F on the viscosity and hydrogen bonds of DES was investigated, respectively. Notably, viscosity, one of the essential physical properties of a liquid, plays a crucial role in electrical conductivity and mass transfer, affecting its suitability in specific applications [26,28]. As depicted in Figure S2a, the viscosity of DES is decreased rapidly at room temperature with increasing the amount of water added until it is close to the viscosity of water $\\mathbf { \\langle 0 . 8 9 m P a \\cdot s \\rangle }$ . In general, most DESs have large ion sizes, tiny void volumes, numerous hydrogen bonds and other in­ teractions such as electrostatic forces or van der Waals interactions among the components of DES, resulting in a high viscosity of DES [32]. It should be noted that, in the case of adding a small amount of deionized water with low density and viscosity, the hydrogen bonds between the components of binary DES are weakened, and the viscosity of DES is decreased until it reaches the viscosity of water. As depicted in the $^ 1 \\mathrm { H }$ NMR spectra of DESs (DES-W–x/y) (Figure S2b), the chemical shifts of protons of ChCl and F move to the low frequency (high energy field) due to the weakening of their intramolecular hydrogen bonds and the for­ mation of intermolecular hydrogen bonds between ChCl and F. Notably, compared to binary DES without water (DES-W-0/1), according to the appearance of new chemical shift of hydrogen protons between 4 ppm and 7 ppm shown in Figure S2b, it is observed that the addition of water can destroy the hydrogen bonds between ChCl and F gradually, resulting in the formation of new hydrogen bonds between ChCl and W. With an increase in the amount of water added, the new chemical shift of hydrogen protons moves to the low frequency. Moreover, it approaches the chemical shift of hydrogen protons of pure water, indicating that the supramolecular structure of DES originated from the intermolecular hydrogen bond network may be destructed intensively with adding an excessive amount of water. Therefore, the ternary DES (DES-W-1/4) formed by adding an appropriate amount of water (mass ratio of W to ChCl and F of 1:4) can not only maintain its supramolecular structure to a certain extent, but also reduce its viscosity significantly, thereby enhancing its pretreatment efficiency upon MAL [28].

These experimental results show that the depolymer­ ization of MAL is more likely to occur on S units during the pretreatment process of DES-W-1/4. Moreover, the increase in the ArOH content of lignin is mainly due to the increase in the relative content of H units. According to the literature [38], the ability of lignin to substitute phenol in the preparation of phenolic resin was closely related to the number of active sites for the reaction with formaldehyde. More G and H units could provide more ortho-positions (C-3 and C-5) as active sites (as shown in Figure S3). Fortunately, DAL-W-1/4 with many active sites mentioned above via DES-W-1/4 pretreatment is very suitable for the preparation of phenolic resin-based functional materials, such as OMC prepared from phenolic resin as carbon precursor using soft-template method.

Notably, the mesoporosity of LDMC-DAL $( 5 3 \\% )$ was much higher than that of LDMC-MAL $( 2 2 \\% )$ , further highlighting an obvious improvement of lignin reactivity to­ wards formaldehyde after DES-W-1/4 pretreatment, which verifies the pretreatment effectiveness of DES-W-1/4 on MAL.

And there is no obvious voltage drop even at high cur­ rent density of $1 0 \\mathrm { A g } ^ { - 1 }$ , highlighting a lower equivalent series resistance and good rate performance [8]. As shown in Fig. 6c, it is worth noting that the specific capacitances of LDMCs calculated from GCD curves decrease gradually with increasing current density. Notably, at the same current density, the specific capacitance of LDMC-DAL is more than twice that of LDMC-MAL probably due to the fact that LDMC-DAL can provide higher specific surface area, orderliness [48] and more suitable ratio of micropores to mesopores [52]. The specific capacitance of LDMC-DAL at current density of $0 . 2 \\mathrm { ~ A ~ g ^ { - 1 } }$ is as high as $1 9 7 . 3 2 \\mathrm { ~ F ~ g } ^ { - 1 }$ . Furthermore, at high current density of $2 0 \\mathrm { A g ^ { - 1 } }$ , the specific capacitance retention rate of LDMC-DAL $( 8 4 \\% )$ is higher than that of LDMC-MAL $( 6 7 \\% )$ , further highlighting a better rate performance of the former probably owing to its relatively low resistance and high response to large current [53].

As mentioned above, LDMC-DAL has higher mesoporosity and orderliness, as well as the uniform inter­ penetrating mesoporous channels, which can not only promote the surface area of accessibility, but also provide wider transmission path to help electrolyte ions reach the micropores [7,51]. Moreover, the higher degree of graphitization of LDMC-DAL can enhance its conductivity and reduce the internal resistance of electron transfer [54].

    "abstracts": "Lignin can be used as a green and sustainable substitute for phenol in the preparation of ordered mesoporous carbon using phenol resin prepolymer as precursor owing to the availability of aromatic ortho-positions in the lignin structure. To further improve the reactivity towards formaldehyde and increase the substitution degree of phenol, masson pine alkali lignin (MAL) was pretreated by an acidic deep eutectic solvent (DES). It was found that adding an appropriate amount of water to DES showed beneficial attributions to the reduction in pretreatment time and the upsurge in the phenolic hydroxyl content of regenerated lignin (DAL). The content of β-O-4 ether bond in MAL was almost cleaved. More importantly, the contents of syringyl and guaiacyl units were decreased. In contrast, the content of p-hydroxyphenyl (H) units was increased obviously, thereby facilitating lignin to react with formaldehyde. Results showed that the optimized DAL with higher content of H units was an appropriate candidate for substituting 100% of phenol in the preparation of highly-ordered lignin-derived mesoporous carbon (LDMC). Finally, the optimized LDMC exhibited high specific capacitance of 197.32 F g -1 at current density of 0.2 A g -1 , high capacitance retention of 84% at current density of 20 A g -1 , superior cyclic stability with capacitance retention rate of 99.09% after 10000 cycles and high energy density of 6.85 Wh•kg -1 at power density of 100 W kg -1 ."
