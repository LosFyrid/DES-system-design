The FTIR spectra of the pure DES and $\\mathrm { D E S } + \\mathrm { D }$ -glucose (molar fraction is 0.11) mixture are shown in Figure 7. For the spectrum of pure DES, $_ \\mathrm { N - H }$ peak appeared at 1668  and $1 6 2 0 ~ \\mathrm { { c m } ^ { - 1 } }$ , which agreed with those reported in the literature [33,40]. Yue reported that the peaks of $_ \\mathrm { N - H }$ shifted to lower wavenumbers due to the formation of strong hydrogen bonds. As seen from Figure 7, the peak of $_ \\mathrm { N - H }$ shifts to lower wavenumber (from $1 6 8 1 ~ \\mathrm { { c m } ^ { - 1 } }$ to $1 6 6 8 ~ \\mathrm { { c m } ^ { - 1 } }$ and from $1 6 2 9 ~ \\mathrm { { c m } ^ { - 1 } }$ to $\\bar { 1 } 6 2 0 { \\mathrm { c m } } ^ { - 1 } ,$ ) due to the formation of strong hydrogen bonds between urea and choline chloride. But with adding the content of D-glucose, two peaks shift back to higher wavenumber (from $1 6 6 8 ~ \\mathrm { { c m } ^ { - 1 } }$ to $1 6 7 7 \\mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ and from $1 6 2 0 \\mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ to $1 6 2 5 \\mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ ), implying that $_ \\mathrm { N - H }$ was stronger than in pure DES which could be due to urea in the hydrogen bond system is partially instead of D-glucose. D-glucose and choline chloride-based DES have much higher viscosity than the DES based on urea and choline chloride [41]. The hydrogen bond formed by $_ \\mathrm { O - H }$ is much stronger than by $_ \\mathrm { N - H }$ , and this can also be realised by comparing the viscosity of pure DES and the mixture of $\\mathrm { D E S + D }$ -glucose.

With the measured density data for the mixture, the values of molecular volume, standard molar entropy and lattice energy were calculated. Also, the free volume values for the mixture were also calculated based on the measured RI data. Both the temperature and D-glucose content had obvious effects on these physical properties for the mixture. Meanwhile, all the measured data for the mixture were correlated.
