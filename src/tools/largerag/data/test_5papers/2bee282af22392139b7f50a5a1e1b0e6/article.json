Consequently, the prior target in chemical production of minimizing the environmental impact of solvents is challenged to find greener solvents [1,2]. In this connection, impressive progress has been made thanks to the emergency of ionic liquids (ILs), which are defined as a group of organic salts with low melting points below $1 0 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ [3-5]. ILs have demonstrated many advantages and harvested continuing success due to their distinct physicochemical properties, including wide liquid range, negligible vapor pressure, low flammability, and designability [6,69,70]. Despite the above merits, the green affiliation of ILs deserves questioned because of their corrosivity and poor biodegradability. Besides, complex synthetic procedure also restricts their large-scale application as well as increases the production cost. Therefore, serious drawbacks of the classic ILs still force to create greener chemical approaches from the point of view of environmental sustainability [7]. ",

Other advanced characteristics, including simple preparation, low cost, biodegradability, provide promising perspectives for scientific innovation. In most cases, the quaternary ammonium salts and phosphate salts are taken as HBA, while comparatively abundant selection of HBDs (for instance, alcohols, amines, organic acids, etc.) can be responsible for the diverse characters of the corresponding DES [7, 10].

The heating method involves mixing, heating and stirring until a homogenous liquid is formed, which is the most commonly used after proposed by Abbott in 2003 [11]. However, as pointed out by Florindo et al. [12], this method may lead to the formation of impurities (HCl and corresponding esters) when choosing ChCl as HBA and carboxylic acids as HBD, which might be ascribed to the too high heating temperature. Accordingly, they explored the grinding method, which integrated mixing and grinding in a mortar with a pestle at room temperature. This method has advantages in preparing DES over the traditional heating method because of the unfavorable formation of ester in the latter. Nevertheless, the heating method is still widely adopted owing to its simple operation. ",

ChCl:2PTSA possess the highest acidity due to the higher acidity of PTSA, which can also manifest the pivotal role of HBD in assessing the acidity of BADES. ",

The band around $1 4 5 0 ~ \\mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ suggests the pyridine coordination to Lewis acid sites; while the band near $1 5 4 0 ~ \\mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ reflects the formation of pyridinium ions due to the existence of Brønsted acidic sites. [25] The increase of the bond wavenumber near $1 4 5 0 ~ \\mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ reflects the enhancement of the Lewis acidity. From Fig. 6, pure pyridine (a) represents a well resolved single band at $1 4 3 7 ~ \\mathrm { { c m } ^ { - 1 } }$ . However, in $\\mathbf { C h C l : } x \\mathbf { Z n C l } _ { 2 }$ (b-d, $\\scriptstyle \\mathbf { X } = 1 - 3$ ) or BTMAC:2ZnCl2 (e), the red shifts from 1437 to $1 4 4 8 ~ \\mathrm { { c m } ^ { - 1 } }$ indicates the coordination of pyridine to Lewis acid sites. The same band shifts of pyridine molecule in these LADES reflect that they have similar Lewis acid strength. Moreover, no Brønsted acid site was observed in $\\mathbf { C h C l : } x \\mathbf { Z n C l } _ { 2 }$ and BTMAC: $2 \\mathrm { Z n C l } _ { 2 }$ since no band appeared at approximately $1 5 4 0 \\mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ .

Besides, two additional factors, including large ion size and small void volume of ADES as well as electrostatic or van der Waals interactions, can account for the high viscosity. In practical process, ADES with lower viscosity is urgently desirable because of their promising applications as green media, which can be designed under the guidance of the Hole theory. Selection of small cations or fluorinated hydrogen-bond donors is favorable to form DES with low viscosity [32]. ",

    "abstracts": "This review divides the acidic deep eutectic solvents (ADES) into Brønsted and Lewis DES according to their diversity of acidic character. The hydrogen bond donors and halide salts for formulating an ADES are classified, the synthesis methods are described, and the physicochemical properties including freezing point, acidity, density, viscosity and conductivity are presented. Furthermore, the applications of Brønsted acidic deep eutectic solvents (BADES) and Lewis acidic deep eutectic solvents (LADES) are overviewed, respectively, covering the fields in dissolution, extraction, organic reaction and metal electrodeposition. It is expected that the ADES has great potential to replace the pollutional mineral acid, expensive and unstable solid acid, and costly ionic liquid in many acid-employed chemical processes, thus meeting the demands of green chemistry."
