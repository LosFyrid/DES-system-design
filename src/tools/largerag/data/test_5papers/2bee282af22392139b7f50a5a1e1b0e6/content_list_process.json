Furthermore, the applications of Brønsted acidic deep eutectic solvents (BADES) and Lewis acidic deep eutectic solvents (LADES) are overviewed, respectively, covering the fields in dissolution, extraction, organic reaction and metal electrodeposition.

Consequently, the prior target in chemical production of minimizing the environmental impact of solvents is challenged to find greener solvents [1,2]. In this connection, impressive progress has been made thanks to the emergency of ionic liquids (ILs), which are defined as a group of organic salts with low melting points below $1 0 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ [3-5]. ILs have demonstrated many advantages and harvested continuing success due to their distinct physicochemical properties, including wide liquid range, negligible vapor pressure, low flammability, and designability [6,69,70]. Despite the above merits, the green affiliation of ILs deserves questioned because of their corrosivity and poor biodegradability. Besides, complex synthetic procedure also restricts their large-scale application as well as increases the production cost. Therefore, serious drawbacks of the classic ILs still force to create greener chemical approaches from the point of view of environmental sustainability [7]. ",

They are usually prepared by a hydrogen bond acceptor (HBA, e.g. a quaternary ammonium salt) with a hydrogen bond donor (HBD, e.g. a carboxylic acid), where the charge delocalization resulting from the hydrogen bond interaction accounts for the melting-point depression of the formed DES [9]. Other advanced characteristics, including simple preparation, low cost, biodegradability, provide promising perspectives for scientific innovation. In most cases, the quaternary ammonium salts and phosphate salts are taken as HBA, while comparatively abundant selection of HBDs (for instance, alcohols, amines, organic acids, etc.) can be responsible for the diverse characters of the corresponding DES [7, 10].

In this review, we classified the ADES into Brønsted acidic deep eutectic solvents (BADES) and Lewis acidic deep eutectic solvents (LADES). BADES display the Brønsted acidity due to ionizable protons, whereas LADES display the Lewis acidity because of a deficiency in electron.

The heating method involves mixing, heating and stirring until a homogenous liquid is formed, which is the most commonly used after proposed by Abbott in 2003 [11]. However, as pointed out by Florindo et al. [12], this method may lead to the formation of impurities (HCl and corresponding esters) when choosing ChCl as HBA and carboxylic acids as HBD, which might be ascribed to the too high heating temperature. Accordingly, they explored the grinding method, which integrated mixing and grinding in a mortar with a pestle at room temperature. This method has advantages in preparing DES over the traditional heating method because of the unfavorable formation of ester in the latter. Nevertheless, the heating method is still widely adopted owing to its simple operation. ",
