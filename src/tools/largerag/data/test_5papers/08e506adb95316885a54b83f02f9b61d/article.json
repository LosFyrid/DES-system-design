The extracted PAHs were  purified and  then measured by  high-performance liquid chromatographyfluorescence detection (HPLC-FL). The  effect  of key  parameters on  extraction recoveries and  precision was investigated. At  optimized conditions, the  studied  samples were  dissolved under  atmospheric pressure in ChCl-Ox (1:2) at $5 5 ^ { \\circ } C$ for $3 0 \\mathrm { m i n }$ , which is considerably lower than the temperature used in the classical and  current methods. After  dissolution, it  took  approximately $2 0 \\mathrm { m i n }$ to  quantitatively extract the  PAHs  from  ChCl-Ox using $5 \\mathrm { m L }$ cyclohexane. Depending on  the analyte, the developed method was linear over  the calibration range  1.0–250,  2.0–250,  and $5 . 0 { - } 2 5 0 \\mathrm { n g } \\mathrm { g } ^ { - 1 }$ ,  with $r ^ { 2 } > 0 . 9 9 6$ . The  detection limits of  the  method were  between 0.50  and $3 . 0 8 \\mathrm { n g g } ^ { - 1 }$ .  The  intra-day and  inter-day precisions (based on the relative standard deviation, $n = 5$ )  of the  spiked  PAHs  at  a concentration level of $5 0 \\mathrm { n g } \\mathrm { g } ^ { - 1 }$ were  better than $1 2 . 6 \\%$ and $1 3 . 3 \\%$ , respectively. Individual PAH  recoveries from spiked  marine  fish  and  macroalgae samples were  in  the  range of $7 1 . 6 \\%$ to $1 0 9 . 6 \\%$ . For  comparison, the  spiked  samples were  also  subjected to the Soxhlet extraction method. The  simplicity of the procedure, high extraction efficiency, short  analysis time, and use of  safe  and inexpensive components suggest the  proposed method has a  high  potential for utilization in routine trace  PAH  analysis in biological samples.

In the marine environment, PAHs are available biologically to marine species via the food chain, as waterborne compounds, and from contaminated sediments.

For solid-based matrices such as food samples, sediments, soil, and marine organisms, classical extraction methods such as Soxhlet extraction with nonpolar solvents are used [11]. This method utilizes large amounts of solvent as well as sample and is considerably time consuming [12]. Another separation protocol of PAHs from lipophilic products is based on saponification in basic alcoholic solution, a process that requires $2 { \\cdot } 4 \\mathrm { h }$ Moreover, the presence of alcohol in the hydrolytic mixture interferes with the alkylated PAH derivatives [10]. Consequently, current methods tend to minimize the consumption of solvents, sample amount, and extraction time with the aid of additional energy and/or pressure to the mixture of sample and solvent [13]. These methods, namely, microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) [14], supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) [15], pressurized liquid extraction (PLE) [16], and ultrasound-assisted extraction (USE) [17], differ in the way that the energy is supplied to the system and the kind of extracting fluid employed.

DESs typically have a very high depression in freezing point and are liquids at temperatures ranging from $2 1 ^ { \\circ } \\mathsf C$ to $7 0 ^ { \\circ } C$ [23]. Choline chloride (ChCl), an inexpensive, biodegradable, and non-toxic quaternary ammonium salt, is widely used as one of the components in the formation of DESs [24]. When combined with non-toxic hydrogen bond donors (HBDs), such as carboxylic acids (e.g., oxalic acid), urea, or polyols (e.g., glycerol), ChCl is capable of rapidly forming a liquid [22–24]. These mixtures can be prepared with high purity and do not react with water, which allows for easy storage. In addition, they are biodegradable, biocompatible, non-toxic, non-flammable, and inexpensive [22]. Charge delocalization that is achieved through hydrogen bonding between the halide anion (e.g., $\\mathbf { C l } ^ { - }$ in ChCl) with an HBD moiety is responsible for formation of the liquid [23].

These findings are in coherence with those outlined in other studies. For example, in 2009, Morrison et al.

Increasing temperature generally reduces the viscosity and the surface tension of a DES and increases the diffusivity of the solvent, which can facilitate the penetration of DES in the matrices of the sample, leading to more breaking down of the intermolecular bonds, and therefore enhancing their solubility [28]. In this work, the effect of increasing temperature on the solubility and extraction of PAHs from their matrices was studied over the range $5 0 { - } 7 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathsf C .$ As can be seen in Fig. 3, the best extraction recoveries of $7 6 . 2 \\substack { - 1 1 3 . 5 \\% }$ for all studied PAHs were obtained when the temperature was held between $5 5 \\mathrm { - } 6 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathsf { C } .$ At temperatures greater than $6 5 ^ { \\circ } \\mathsf C ,$ the extraction recoveries of both the 3- and 4-ring PAHs were rapidly reduced, but the extraction recoveries of the 5-ring PAHs reached $6 4 . 8 \\substack { - 7 4 . 9 \\% }$ . This effect may be related to the more evaporation of the $3 -$ and 4-ring PAHs at higher temperatures, because of their inherently higher vapor pressure, compared to the 5-ring PAHs. At temperatures lower than $5 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathsf C ,$ the dissolution of the sample in ChCl-Ox (1:2) was incomplete and led to relatively low extraction recoveries, for some PAHs. Therefore, to obtain quantitative and precise results, the temperature of the ChCl-Ox was set at $5 5 ^ { \\circ } \\mathsf { C }$ Compared to microwave-assisted and accelerated extraction methods, this method can proceed successfully at relatively lower temperatures and at atmospheric pressure [34–36].

The nature of the solvent is of prime importance and should meet three criteria: efficiency, selectivity, and compatibility. Therefore, the following considerations should be taken into account when selecting an appropriate solvent for efficient extraction of PAHs. First of all, PAHs should have high solubility in the solvent. Secondly, the solvent should be immiscible or have low solubility in DESs to minimize the loss of solvent in the eutectic-based solution. Thirdly, the solvent should have low vapor pressure to prevent evaporative loss during extraction. Based on these criteria, and from our own experience and literature reports, four organic solvents, dichloromethane, toluene, cyclohexane, and $n$ -hexane were studied. Fig. 4 shows that the best recoveries $( 7 2 \\% - 1 1 0 \\% )$ of all PAHs were achieved using cyclohexane and dichloromethane for extraction. Solvents such as $n$ -hexane and toluene provided recoveries in the range of $4 1 \\% - 9 6 \\%$ . However, cyclohexane was more selective than dichloromethane for extraction of PAHs, since dichloromethane extracted larger amounts of lipids that were soluble and/or turn to solid at room temperature and then partly co-eluted with PAHs during the cleanup stage. These results are in accordance with previous reports [5,34–37]. Therefore, cyclohexane was selected as a proper extracting solvent. ",

Therefore, the effect of the dissolution time on the extraction was studied at five time intervals between 20–60 min. According to the results presented in Fig. 7, the extraction recoveries of all PAHs increased as the dissolution time of the sample in ChCl-Ox (1:2) was increased from 20 to $4 0 \\mathrm { m i n }$ . The best results (recoveries and precisions) for all PAHs was obtained when the sample was completely dissolved in ChCl-Ox (1:2) within $3 0 \\mathrm { m i n }$ , therefore this time was selected as the optimum dissolution time.

In contrast, only up to $3 5 \\%$ decrease in the recoveries of the 5-ring PAHs was reported, and the results were still repeatable.

The muscles of two kinds of marine fish samples, including Kafshak (P. flesus) and Shoorideh (O. ruber) as well as the marine macroalgae (E. intentinalis) were selected for study using this method. After pre-treatment, each sample was subjected to the proposed procedure, under optimal conditions. Additionally, each sample was spiked with $5 0 \\mathrm { n g } \\mathrm { g } ^ { - 1 }$ of PAH, and the recoveries of extraction as well as the precisions (RSDs, $\\mathrm { n } = 5$ ) were calculated and summarized in Table 2. The extraction recoveries of the spiked samples ranged from $7 0 . 0 \\%$ to $1 0 9 . 6 \\%$ , with RSDs of below $1 1 . 7 \\%$ . As can be seen, the concentration of Ph in all samples is considerably higher than other PAHs. Similarly, S. de Mora et al. [32] pointed out the considerably high concentrations of $\\mathrm { P h }$ in water, sediment, and fish samples collected from the north of the Persian Gulf. In Fig. 9, the HPLC-FL chromatograms of the extracted PAHs from the spiked (at $5 0 \\mathrm { n g } \\mathrm { g } ^ { - 1 }$ ) and non-spiked samples of a fish muscle of O. ruber are presented. Since the concentration of Ph was relatively high, the other studied PAHs were not clearly observed in the nonspiked chromatogram, but each of PAHs was detected by HLPC-FL. All these facts demonstrate that this new ChCl-Ox extraction procedure has a great potential for application to genuine environmental samples. ",

In the present work, a novel extraction technique based on the complete dissolution of marine biological samples in ChCl-Ox deep eutectic solvent was developed for convenient and quantitative extraction of PAHs. The extracted PAHs were then determined with HPLC-FL. This method provides some operational advantages such as simplicity of experimental procedure, use of low-cost eutectic solvent, relatively high-speed sample preparation, consumption of low amount of sample, and low organic solvent usage. Thus, this method demonstrates potential for routine trace PAH analysis in biological samples. Compared to routine extraction methods, such as MAE and PLE, the process of dissolution and extraction of PAHs can be conducted at relatively lower temperatures at atmospheric pressure. Under the most favorable conditions, the developed method exhibited particularly good limits of detection, linearity, and satisfactory repeatability. Overall, this study demonstrated that the proposed method is an efficient approach for the sample preparation of marine biological samples such as fish muscle and macralgae. This new approach opens an interesting and innovative way in the field of sample preparation methods for effectively handling complex samples. ",

    "abstracts": "A novel sample preparation method based on the complete dissolution of marine biological samples in choline chloride-oxalic acid (ChCl-Ox) deep eutectic solvent was developed for fast and efficient extraction of eight polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) using minimum volumes of cyclohexane. The extracted PAHs were purified and then measured by high-performance liquid chromatographyfluorescence detection (HPLC-FL). The effect of key parameters on extraction recoveries and precision was investigated. At optimized conditions, the studied samples were dissolved under atmospheric pressure in ChCl-Ox (1:2) at 55 • C for 30 min, which is considerably lower than the temperature used in the classical and current methods. After dissolution, it took approximately 20 min to quantitatively extract the PAHs from ChCl-Ox using 5 mL cyclohexane. Depending on the analyte, the developed method was linear over the calibration range 1.0-250, 2.0-250, and 5.0-250 ng g -1 , with r 2 > 0.996. The detection limits of the method were between 0.50 and 3.08 ng g -1 . The intra-day and inter-day precisions (based on the relative standard deviation, n = 5) of the spiked PAHs at a concentration level of 50 ng g -1 were better than 12.6% and 13.3%, respectively. Individual PAH recoveries from spiked marine fish and macroalgae samples were in the range of 71.6% to 109.6%. For comparison, the spiked samples were also subjected to the Soxhlet extraction method. The simplicity of the procedure, high extraction efficiency, short analysis time, and use of safe and inexpensive components suggest the proposed method has a high potential for utilization in routine trace PAH analysis in biological samples."
