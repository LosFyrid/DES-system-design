On the other hand, honey is polluted with pesticides through air, water, soil, and plants that bees visit and collect nectar to produce honey. 8 The analysis of pesticides in honey samples is vital to warrant consumers’ safety and obtain information ",

            "paragraph": "about the use of pesticides in crop fields and neighborhoods. In most studies, honey is considered as a biomarker of the environment. As a result, performing an analytical method is needed for the determination of pesticides in honey samples. Up to now, different instrumental analyses consisting of gas chromatography (GC) 9 high performance liquid chromatography 10, and capillary electrophoresis 11 have been used for the determination of pesticides in honey samples. Since honey is composed of different carbohydrates, minerals, flavonoids, pigments, and organic acids, its matrix is very complex, so performing a sample preparation step before the instrumental analysis is necessary. Liquid–liquid extraction 12 and solid phase extraction 13 are the most well–known extraction methods which are used in many samples. In spite of the simplicity and easiness of these procedures, the need for large volumes of organic solvents or expensive cartridge has limited their applications in recent years. As a result, many attempts have been made to develop sample preparation methods in which the organic solvents were eliminated or used in $\\mu \\mathrm { L }$ –level. Therefore, solid phase microextraction 14 and liquid phase microextraction (LPME) 15, 16 methods have been and developed. LPME is based on the distribution of the analyte(s) between the sample matrix and a few microliters of a water-immiscible organic solvent 15, deep eutectic solvent (DES) 17, or ionic liquid (IL) 18. LPME is categorized into three main procedures including single drop microextraction, hollow–fiber LPME, and dispersive liquid–liquid microextraction (DLLME). DLLME is an important extraction method which is used as a sample preparation procedure in many samples. In this procedure, the analytes are transferred from sample solution into a few microliters of a water–immiscible solvent (extraction solvent) dispersed in the sample solution with the aid of a water–miscible solvent (dispersive solvent). The main advantages of DLLME are high extraction efficiency and mass transfer rate 19. The major disadvantage of traditional DLLME methods is the use of halogenated solvents as the extraction solvents which are highly toxic for human health and environment. Also, handling these solvents in the laboratory is difficult and unsafe. Therefore, relatively safe solvents such as lighter than water ",

In the present study, the tested DESs needed to have several characteristics such as suitable vapor pressure, extraction capability of the analytes, higher density than water, and low solubility in aqueous phase. Among these factors, the vapor pressure of the DES had to be considered to avoid contamination of the ionic source of MS and injection port of the GC. The effect of extraction solvent type on the efficiency of the method was evaluated by performing different experiments using three DESs consisting of PChCl: DCA: hexanoic acid (m.p. 9 ⁰C), PChCl: DCA: octanoic acid (m.p. 13⁰C), and PChCl: DCA: decanoic acid (m.p. 16⁰C).

For this purpose, $8 3 ~ \\mu \\mathrm { L }$ of PChCl: DCA: hexanoic acid, $7 5 ~ \\mu \\mathrm { L }$ of PChCl: DCA: octanoic acid, and $6 8 ~ \\mu \\mathrm { L }$ of PChCl: DCA: decanoic acid were mixed with $1 . 3 ~ \\mathrm { m L }$ acetonitrile phase obtained from the pervious step. Figure 4 shows the obtained analytical signals for the analytes.

    "abstracts": "A new type of deep eutectic solvent based on three components using phosphate salts has been synthesized, characterized, and applied in the extraction of eight organothiophosphate pesticides from honey samples. In the present study, the deep eutectic solvent was prepared from phosphocholine choline chloride as a hydrogen bond acceptor and dichloroacetic acid and decanoic acid as hydrogen bond donors. The method consisted of two steps in which initially the analytes were extracted from the samples into a water-miscible organic solvent. In the second step, the extracted phase was mixed with the prepared deep eutectic solvent and the mixture was used in the following dispersive liquidliquid microextraction method.\nThe method was validated under optimal conditions, and it was found that the method has low limits of detection (0.05-0.10 ng g -1 ) and quantification (0.19-0.36 ng g -1 ), good linearity (r 2 ≥ 0.994), broad linearity (0.36-1000 ng g -1 ), and satisfactory repeatability (relative standard deviation ≤ 10% for intra-(n=6) and inter-day (n=4) precisions at a concentration of 2 ng g -1 of each analyte).\nFinally, the proposed method was applied in different honey samples, and malathion was found at a concentration of 29 ng g -1 in one sample."
